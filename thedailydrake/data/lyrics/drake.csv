Family Matters,"Your baby mama captions always screamin', ""Save me"""
Family Matters,"You did her dirty all your life, you tryna make peace"
Family Matters,I heard that one of 'em little kids might be Dave Free

Family Matters,"Still mad about that one ho, we ain't even fuck, I just lip-locked with her"
Family Matters,"I get active when it's war time, I ain't even really let my dick drop, nigga"
Family Matters,"What the fuck I heard Rick drop, nigga? Talkin' somethin' 'bout a nose job, nigga"
Family Matters,Ozempic got a side effect of jealousy and doctor never told y'all niggas
Family Matters,"Put a nigga in the bars, let a nigga rot, kind of like your old job, nigga"
Family Matters,"House sittin' on some land, but it's out where no one even really know y'all niggas"
Family Matters,"Bitches gotta drive two hours 'fore you pay 'em just to give a blowjob, nigga"
Family Matters,Must've snorted up a snowball
Family Matters,"'Cause my last record deal was four hundred M's, these days, that's a low ball, nigga"
Family Matters,Ayy
Family Matters,Who's next on the list?
Family Matters,Which one of my so-called niggas
Family Matters,Which one of my so-called niggas
Family Matters,Which one of my so-called niggas need a shell from the clip?
Family Matters,Always knew I had to smoke y'all niggas
Family Matters,"​good kid, m.A.A.d city"
Family Matters," van, we'll pop the latch and let the door slide"
Family Matters,"Tears runnin' down my cheek, laughin' at you pussies dyin', it's a war cry"
Family Matters,Weeknd music gettin' played in all the spots where boys got a little more pride
Family Matters,"That's why all your friends dippin' to Atlanta, payin' just to find a tour guide"
Family Matters,"Abel, run your fuckin' bread, need to buy some more chains for some more guys"
Family Matters,Let me find another street nigga I can take to the game courtside
Family Matters,"Let me get a used Ferrari for a rapper, take the nigga on a horse ride"
Family Matters,Anything to take the spotlight off the fact the boss is a drugged-out lil' punk sissy from the Northside
Family Matters,Rakim talkin' shit again
Family Matters,"Gassed 'cause you hit my BM first, nigga, do the math, who I was hittin' then?"
Family Matters,I ain't even know you rapped still 'cause they only talkin' 'bout your 'fit again
Family Matters,Probably gotta have a kid again 'fore you think of droppin' any shit again
Family Matters,"Even when you do drop, they gon' say you should've modeled 'cause it's mid again"
Family Matters,"Smokin' Fenty 'bout it, should've put you on the first one, tryna get it in"
Family Matters,Ask Fring if this a good idea the next time you cuddled in that bed again
Family Matters,She'll even tell you leave the boy alone 'fore you get your head split again
Family Matters,"Pluto shit make me sick to my stomach, we ain't never really been through it"
Family Matters,"Leland Wayne, he a fuckin' lame, so I know he had to be an influence"
Family Matters,These niggas had a plan and they finally found a way to rope you into it
Family Matters,"Two separate albums dissin', I just did a Kim to it, nigga, skim through it"
Family Matters,"Me and Savage had the hoes drippin' wet at shows, almost had to swim to it"
Family Matters,K-Dot shit is only hittin' hard when Baby Keem put his pen to it
Family Matters,Ross callin' me the white boy and the shit kind of got a ring to it
Family Matters,'Cause all these rappers wavin' white flags while the whole fuckin' club sing to it
Family Matters,"Murder scene on your man tonight, then come to the vigil with the candlelight"
Family Matters,Body after fuckin' body and you know Rick readin' my Miranda rights
Family Matters,"I'm goin' on vacation now, hope next time y'all plan it right"
Family Matters,"'Cause you gotta pay for sayin' my name, guess now niggas understand the price"
Family Matters,"Nigga, what? ("
Family Matters,6ix
Family Matters,)

Family Matters,"West Coast niggas do fades, right? Come get this ass whoopin', I'm handin' 'em out"
Family Matters,You wanna take up for Pharrell? Then come get his legacy out of my house
Family Matters,"A cease and desist is for hoes, can't listen to lies that come out of your mouth"
Family Matters,You called the Tupac estate and begged 'em to sue me and get that shit down
Family Matters,"I'm losin' perspective on beef, Boi-1da send beat and I'll kill you for fun"
Family Matters,"Your daddy got robbed by Top,"
Family Matters, 
Family Matters,"you Stunna and Wayne, like father, like son"
Family Matters,"Anthony set up the plays, Kojo be chargin' you double for nothin'"
Family Matters,"They shook about what I'ma say, but textin' your phone like, ""We already won"""
Family Matters,"You tell me what I shouldn't say, but fuck it, my nigga, it's already done"
Family Matters,"We already know it's a twenty-v-one, we already know why you went number one"
Family Matters,"It's clearly because of The Boy, the honorable thing is to give me the loot"
Family Matters,"You right about ""Fuck the big three,"" it's only Big D, and there's video proof"
Family Matters,"Our sons should go play at the park, two lightskin kids, that shit would be cute"
Family Matters,Unless you don't want to be seen with anyone that isn't Blacker than you
Family Matters,"We get it, we got it"
Family Matters,"The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice"
Family Matters,We get that you like to put gin in your juice
Family Matters,We get that you think that you Bishop in 
Family Matters,Juice
Family Matters,"When you put your hands on your girl, is it self-defense 'cause she bigger than you?"
Family Matters,"Your back is up against the curb, you diggin' for dirt, should be diggin' for proof"
Family Matters,Why did you move to New York? Is it 'cause you livin' that bachelor life?
Family Matters,"Proposed in 2015, but don't wanna make her your actual wife"
Family Matters,"I'm guessin' this wedding ain't happenin', right?"
Family Matters,'Cause we know the girls that you actually like
Family Matters,Your darkest secrets are comin' to light
Family Matters,It's all on your face like what happened to Mike
Family Matters,"Oh shit, it's all makin' sense, maybe I'm Prince and you actually Mike"
Family Matters,Michael was prayin' his features would change so people believe that he's actually white
Family Matters,"Top would make you do features for change, get on pop records and rap for the whites"
Family Matters,"And wait, you say your brother Jermaine, but you wanted him to stay out of the light"
Family Matters,"Oh shit, just follow me, right? 'Cause nothin' you sayin' could bother me, right?"
Family Matters,"I get off the plane and nothing has changed, I head to Delilah with all of my ice"
Family Matters,"Head to Delilah with all of my ice, head to Delilah with all of my ice"
Family Matters,"This shit gotta be over by now for anyone out here that's calling it, right?"
Family Matters,You're dead
Family Matters,"You're dead, you're dead"
Family Matters,"There's nowhere to hide, there's nowhere to hide, you know what I mean"
Family Matters,They hired a crisis management team to clean up the fact that you beat on your queen
Family Matters,"The picture you painted ain't what it seem, you're dead"

From Time,From Time Lyrics
From Time,What's up?
From Time,"Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up"
From Time,"With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love"
From Time,You shouldn't have to deal with that
From Time,I'd never make you feel like that
From Time,'Cause...
From Time,I love me
From Time,I love me enough for the both of us
From Time,That's why you trust me
From Time,I know you been through more than most of us
From Time,So what are you
From Time,"What are you, what are you so afraid of?"
From Time,"Darling, you"
From Time,"You give, but you cannot take love"
From Time,"Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive"
From Time,"Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance"
From Time,"I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping"
From Time,I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
From Time,Started realizing a couple places I could take it
From Time,I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
From Time,"I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation"
From Time,And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
From Time,"I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience"
From Time,Just me and my old man getting back to basics
From Time,We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
From Time,"When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing"
From Time,"Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas"
From Time,"We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us"
From Time,We even talked about you and our couple of moments
From Time,He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
From Time,"You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone"
From Time,Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
From Time,My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
From Time,"""Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?"""
From Time,You don't even know what you want from love anymore
From Time,I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
From Time,"But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?"
From Time,"Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?"
From Time,I love me
From Time,I love me enough for the both of us
From Time,That's why you trust me
From Time,I know you been through more than most of us
From Time,So what are you
From Time,"What are you, what are you so afraid of?"
From Time,"Darling, you"
From Time,"You give, but you cannot take love"
From Time,"Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures"
From Time,"Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage"
From Time,When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
From Time,"A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it"
From Time,'Cause that night I played her three songs
From Time,Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
From Time,Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
From Time,"Boy, was she wrong"
From Time,That was just negative energy for me to feed off
From Time,Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
From Time,Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
From Time,Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
From Time,When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
From Time,The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
From Time,I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
From Time,"Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?"
From Time,"Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't"
From Time,Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
From Time,"Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out"
From Time,I guess I fucked up the vision
From Time,Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
From Time,"When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven"
From Time,It seem like you don't want this love anymore
From Time,"I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore"
From Time,"But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?"
From Time,"Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?"
From Time,I love me
From Time,I love me enough for the both of us
From Time,That's why you trust me
From Time,I know you been through more than most of us
From Time,So what are you
From Time,"What are you, what are you so afraid of?"
From Time,"Darling, you"
From Time,"You give, but you cannot take love"
From Time,"Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G"
From Time,Been a East Side ting
From Time,"Scarborough ting from time, G"
From Time,"Been have up di ting dem from time, G"
From Time,So I don't know what's wrong with these

Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,Like I should be dressing different
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,Like I didn't study the game to the letter
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,"Man, I'm doing it better"
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,"Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that"
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,"But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em"
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,With someone else other than Paris for once
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,"I text her from time to time, she a mom now"
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,"I told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound"
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,But I think she's straight
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,Right before Wayne came and got me
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2, 
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,out of the back room
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,In the hopes for the glory
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,He walked right past in the hallway
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,"Three months later, I'm his artist"
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,He probably wouldn't remember that story
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,But that shit stick with me always
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,Couldn't believe when he called me
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,You never know what could happen to you
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,"Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg"
Pound Cake Paris Morton Music 2,"Nothing was the same, dawg"

Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,Or they go to Georgia State where
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,That she only see when she feels obligated
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,Admitted it to me the first time we dated
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,But she was no angel and we never waited
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,"I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck"
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,"So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it"
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,And we never talked too much after I blew up
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,"Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated"""
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,And I think I text her and told her I made it
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,"Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded"
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,She asked what have I learned since getting richer?
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,"Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' with ya, damn"
Hyfr Hell Ya Fucking Right,Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past

Summer Sixteen,Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
Summer Sixteen,"I’m just a sicko, a real sicko when you get to know me, nigga"
Summer Sixteen,"I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga"
Summer Sixteen,"We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed"

Summer Sixteen,I coulda killed you the first time
Summer Sixteen,"You don’t have to try and say it louder, nigga"
Summer Sixteen,"Trust, we heard you the first time"
Summer Sixteen,It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
Summer Sixteen,And I blame where I came from
Summer Sixteen,And I blame all my day ones
Summer Sixteen,You know Chubbs like Draymond

Summer Sixteen,How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
Summer Sixteen,"You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us"
Summer Sixteen,"Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up"
Summer Sixteen,"But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake"

Take Care,What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
Take Care,"I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know"
Take Care,"They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real"

Take Care,And you can't sleep thinkin' that he lies still
Take Care,"So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase"
Take Care,"Big girls all get a little taste, aw"
Take Care,"Pushing me away so I give her space, aw"
Take Care,Dealin' with a heart that I didn't break
Take Care,"I'll be there for you, I would care for you"

Too Much,Too Much Lyrics
Too Much,Let’s try one more time
Too Much,Cool
Too Much,"Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
Too Much,There's no need for us to rush it through
Too Much,"Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
Too Much,This is more than just a new lust for you
Too Much,Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Too Much,Last time was on the outgo
Too Much,"Stuck in the house, need to get out more"
Too Much,I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Too Much,Most people in my position get complacent
Too Much,Wanna come places with star girls
Too Much,And they end up on them front pages
Too Much,"I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it"
Too Much,"Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it"
Too Much,I'm the only one that's putting shots up
Too Much,"And like a pot luck, you need to come with it, don't run from it"
Too Much,"Like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it one-hunnid"
Too Much,Met a lot of girls in my times there
Too Much,"Word to Paul Wall, not one fronted"
Too Much,I was birthed there in my first year
Too Much,"Man, I know that place like I come from it"
Too Much,"Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like, ""Is Bun coming?"
Too Much,"Fuck that, is anyone comin'"
Too Much,"'Fore I show up there and there's no one there?"""
Too Much,"These days, I could probably pack it"
Too Much,For like twenty nights if I go in there
Too Much,"Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out"
Too Much,"Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now"
Too Much,"Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out"
Too Much,"She tell me, ""Take a deep breath"
Too Much,"You're too worried about being the best out"""
Too Much,"Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
Too Much,There's no need for us to rush it through
Too Much,"Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
Too Much,This is more than just a new lust for you
Too Much,"Uh, someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods"
Too Much,Money got my whole family going backwards
Too Much,"No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'"
Too Much,There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
Too Much,I did not sign up for this
Too Much,My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
Too Much,"And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess"""
Too Much,"Nah, fuck that shit"
Too Much,"Listen, man, you can still do what you wanna do"
Too Much,You gotta trust that shit
Too Much,Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign
Too Much,That's when they appear
Too Much,"Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here"
Too Much,I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment
Too Much,Telling herself that she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit
Too Much,Like that's true shit
Too Much,And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Too Much,"Started treating me like I'm ""him"" now"
Too Much,"Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together"
Too Much,We just friends now
Too Much,Shit got me feeling pinned down
Too Much,Pick the pen up or put the pen down?
Too Much,I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen-pal
Too Much,But we've been down
Too Much,"Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
Too Much,There's no need for us to rush it through
Too Much,"Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
Too Much,This is more than just a new lust for you
Too Much,"Oh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
Too Much,"There's no need for us to rush it through, oh"
Too Much,"Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
Too Much,"This is more than just a new lust for you, oh, oh"
Too Much,"Don't give up, on your hopes"
Too Much,And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Too Much,"Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care"
Too Much,"'Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense"
Too Much,"Well, if it's all a dream"
Too Much,"Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire"
Too Much,"Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'"

The Heart Part 6,The Pulitzer Prize winner is definitely spiralin'
The Heart Part 6,"I got your fucking lines tapped, I swear that I'm dialed in"
The Heart Part 6,"First, I was a rat, so where's the proof of the trial then?"
The Heart Part 6,Where's the paperwork or the cabinet it's filed in?
The Heart Part 6,1090 Jake woulda took all the walls down

The Heart Part 6,"But you so thirsty, you not concerned with investigation"

The Heart Part 6,The Maybach glove and the drug he uses for less inflation
The Heart Part 6,"Master manipulator, you bit on the speculation"
The Heart Part 6,"You dumb and reactive, nigga, I'm petty with dedication"
The Heart Part 6,What about the bones we dug up in that excavation?
The Heart Part 6,And why isn't Whitney denyin' all of the allegations?
The Heart Part 6,Why is she followin' Dave Free and not Mr. Morale?

The Heart Part 6,"Speakin' of anything with a child, let's get to that now"
The Heart Part 6,This Epstein angle was the shit I expected
The Heart Part 6,TikTok videos you collected and dissected
The Heart Part 6,Instead of bein' on some diss-direct shit
The Heart Part 6,You rather fucking grab your pen and misdirect shit
The Heart Part 6,"My mom came over today, and I was like, ""Mother, I—"

The Heart Part 6,I'm way too famous for this shit you just suggested
The Heart Part 6,"But that's not the lesson, clearly, there's a deeper message"

Do Not Disturb,[Intro: Snoh Aalegra & 
Do Not Disturb,Drake
Do Not Disturb,]
Do Not Disturb,Silence keeps cloudin' me
Do Not Disturb,Hand on my heart
Do Not Disturb,"And I, I wish time never mattered ("
Do Not Disturb,Yeah
Do Not Disturb,)
Do Not Disturb,Stylin’ though
Do Not Disturb,Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
Do Not Disturb,"All the things you need, you still want problems though"
Do Not Disturb,"All the things I know, I still been silent though"
Do Not Disturb,"Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo"
Do Not Disturb,"Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes"
Do Not Disturb,I don't want to have to go to funerals
Do Not Disturb,I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
Do Not Disturb,I don't have no time to be no Romeo
Do Not Disturb,All the love I need is at the rodeo
Do Not Disturb,"All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah"
Do Not Disturb,All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Do Not Disturb,Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Do Not Disturb,Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Do Not Disturb,"Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone"
Do Not Disturb,I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Do Not Disturb,Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
Do Not Disturb,I need forty-thousand people to see what I'm on
Do Not Disturb,"Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves"
Do Not Disturb,I was an angry yute while I was writin’ 
Do Not Disturb,Views
Do Not Disturb,Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
Do Not Disturb,"I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do"
Do Not Disturb,Steady doin' double shifts
Do Not Disturb,1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
Do Not Disturb,More blessings because I'm generous
Do Not Disturb,Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Do Not Disturb,Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
Do Not Disturb,"She knew that shit was a fraud, but never told me about it"
Do Not Disturb,"Nowadays when we catchin' up, we just laugh about it"
Do Not Disturb,Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Do Not Disturb,Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Do Not Disturb,Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
Do Not Disturb,I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
Do Not Disturb,But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Do Not Disturb,"Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days"
Do Not Disturb,Never stick around to see shit change
Do Not Disturb,"Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'"
Do Not Disturb,Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Do Not Disturb,Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
Do Not Disturb,To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
Do Not Disturb,I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Do Not Disturb,"Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense"
Do Not Disturb,Especially people that want to lecture me
Do Not Disturb,And frame it like they just want the best for me
Do Not Disturb,"Or they check for me, whatever splits it up"
Do Not Disturb,So there's more for them and there's less for me
Do Not Disturb,They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
Do Not Disturb,No one's done it successfully
Do Not Disturb,"7 a.m. in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me"
Do Not Disturb,Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Do Not Disturb,Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
Do Not Disturb,That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Do Not Disturb,Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Do Not Disturb,"Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly"
Do Not Disturb,"If we do a song, it's like takin' my kids to work with me"
Do Not Disturb,"You overnight celebrity, you one day star"
Do Not Disturb,Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
Do Not Disturb,I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Do Not Disturb,"Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshiping"
Do Not Disturb,"Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me"
Do Not Disturb,There's real ones around me
Do Not Disturb,I want to make sure they learn from me
Do Not Disturb,"I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety"
Do Not Disturb,He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
Do Not Disturb,My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Do Not Disturb,"Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery"
Do Not Disturb,Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
Do Not Disturb,I'll be back 2018 to give you the summary
Do Not Disturb,More Life

Teenage Fever,Your heart is hard to carry after dark
Teenage Fever,You're to blame for what we could have been 'cause look at what we are
Teenage Fever,Your friends are scared to tell you you went too far
Teenage Fever,Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
Teenage Fever,I met someone new last night and we kicked it
Teenage Fever,And I'm going back there tonight
Teenage Fever,"And you know what's on my mind, this time"
Teenage Fever,Going back there tonight
Teenage Fever,"And you know what's on my mind, so"
Teenage Fever,If you had my love
Teenage Fever,And I gave you all my trust
Teenage Fever,Would you comfort me?
Teenage Fever,And if somehow you knew
Teenage Fever,That your love would be untrue
Teenage Fever,Would you lie to me?
Teenage Fever,If you had my love
Teenage Fever,And I gave you all my trust
Teenage Fever,Would you comfort me?
Teenage Fever,And if somehow you knew
Teenage Fever,That your love would be untrue
Teenage Fever,Would you lie to me?
Teenage Fever,Out of body
Teenage Fever,"That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty"
Teenage Fever,Last night we didn't say it
Teenage Fever,"But girl, we both thought it"
Teenage Fever,Why second guess? I should have stayed
Teenage Fever,"You say the word, I'm on the way"
Teenage Fever,This shit feels like teenage fever
Teenage Fever,"I'm not scared of it, she ain't either"
Teenage Fever,Why second guess? I should have stayed
Teenage Fever,"'Cause you know what's on my mind, so"
Teenage Fever,If you had my love
Teenage Fever,And I gave you all my trust
Teenage Fever,Would you comfort me?
Teenage Fever,And if somehow you knew
Teenage Fever,That your love would be untrue
Teenage Fever,Would you lie to me?
Teenage Fever,If you had my love
Teenage Fever,And I gave you all my trust
Teenage Fever,Would you comfort me?
Teenage Fever,And if somehow you knew
Teenage Fever,That your love would be untrue
Teenage Fever,Would you lie to me?
Teenage Fever,"Yeah, slightly, huh, took a left turn there"
Teenage Fever,But very much 6 a.m.​
Teenage Fever,Slightly been awake for twenty-four hours
Teenage Fever,So please forgive me
Teenage Fever,More ideas and stuff comin'
Teenage Fever,"Yeah, yeah, fam, I'm wafflin'"
Teenage Fever,"But man is tired, fam, Jesus Christ"

Look What Youve Done,Look What You’ve Done Lyrics
Look What Youve Done,Yeah
Look What Youve Done,Yeah
Look What Youve Done,Man
Look What Youve Done,It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
Look What Youve Done,"And I still love her, but it fell through because I wasn't ready"
Look What Youve Done,"And your back hurt, and your neck hurt and you smokin' heavy"
Look What Youve Done,"And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly"
Look What Youve Done,"And then you ash it, and we argue about spendin' money on bullshit"
Look What Youve Done,"And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it"
Look What Youve Done,"Now it's fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat"
Look What Youve Done,And I leave out and you call me and you tell me that you sorry
Look What Youve Done,"And you love me and I love you and your heart hurts, mine does too"
Look What Youve Done,"And it's just words and they cut deep, but it's our world, it's just us two"
Look What Youve Done,"I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad"
Look What Youve Done,"But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard if you were healthy and it weren't so bad, uh"
Look What Youve Done,Maybe I should walk up the street
Look What Youve Done,And try and get a job at the bank
Look What Youve Done,"'Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks"
Look What Youve Done,We'll probably end up robbin' a bank
Look What Youve Done,Then Wayne calls up my phone
Look What Youve Done,Conversation wasn't that long
Look What Youve Done,Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Look What Youve Done,"Oh, it's my time, yeah, it's on"
Look What Youve Done,"He's thinkin' of signin' me, I come home"
Look What Youve Done,We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
Look What Youve Done,And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
Look What Youve Done,"They love your son, man, that boy gone"
Look What Youve Done,You get the operation you dreamed of
Look What Youve Done,And I finally send you to Rome
Look What Youve Done,And get to make good on my promise
Look What Youve Done,"It all worked out, girl, we should've known"
Look What Youve Done,'Cause you deserve it
Look What Youve Done,Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
Look What Youve Done,"After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah"
Look What Youve Done,"Look what you've done, look what you've done"
Look What Youve Done,"Look what you've done for me now, yeah"
Look What Youve Done,You knew that I was gon' be somethin'
Look What Youve Done,"When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah"
Look What Youve Done,"Look what you've done, look what you've done"
Look What Youve Done,"Look what you've, look what you've"
Look What Youve Done,"It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade"
Look What Youve Done,And I'm still in love 'cause when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
Look What Youve Done,"And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way"
Look What Youve Done,"Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid, damn"
Look What Youve Done,"Boohoo, sad story, Black American dad story"
Look What Youve Done,"Know that I'm your sister's kid, but it still don't explain the love that you have for me"
Look What Youve Done,I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Look What Youve Done,"Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons"
Look What Youve Done,For all of my summer romances
Look What Youve Done,"I never really had no one like you, man, this all new shit"
Look What Youve Done,Made the world I know bigger
Look What Youve Done,Changed the way that I viewed it
Look What Youve Done,Had all this fightin' going on at the crib
Look What Youve Done,You would calm me down when I lose it
Look What Youve Done,Told you I think I'm done acting
Look What Youve Done,Now I'm more in touch with the music
Look What Youve Done,"You said, either way, I'd be a star, I could go so far"
Look What Youve Done,"Talked to me, then you got to me"
Look What Youve Done,"Then you'd toss the keys and loan me your car, yeah"
Look What Youve Done,Just a young kid in a drop-top Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Look What Youve Done,Just another kid that's going through life so worried that I won't be accepted
Look What Youve Done,But I could do anything
Look What Youve Done,"You said that, and you meant that"
Look What Youve Done,"You took me places, you spent that"
Look What Youve Done,"They said no, we went back"
Look What Youve Done,"Checks bounced, but we bounced back"
Look What Youve Done,I put all the money in your accounts back
Look What Youve Done,"And I thank you, I don't know where I'd really be without that"
Look What Youve Done,"It worked out, man, you deserve it"
Look What Youve Done,Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
Look What Youve Done,"After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah"
Look What Youve Done,"Look what you've done, look what you've done"
Look What Youve Done,"Look what you've done for me now, yeah"
Look What Youve Done,You knew that I was gon' be somethin'
Look What Youve Done,"When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah"
Look What Youve Done,"Look what you've done, look what you've done"
Look What Youve Done,"Look what you've, look what you've"
Look What Youve Done,Hi Aubrey
Look What Youve Done,I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk
Look What Youve Done,"And he knew, knows how to get in touch with you now"
Look What Youve Done,To let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this
Look What Youve Done,In this comfortable place
Look What Youve Done,"All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together"
Look What Youve Done,And the times I used to look after you
Look What Youve Done,And I still have wonderful feeling about that
Look What Youve Done,So God bless you
Look What Youve Done,And I hope I'll see you
